# HoverButton
Alternatively called a mouseover or mouse hover, hover describes the act of moving a mouse pointer over a clickable object, but not actually clicking the left or right mouse button. For example, when you hover your mouse over any of the links on this page, they should change color, indicating they can be clicked
